          The change from Polymer 0.5 to 1.0 is a large one, as we transitioned
          from exploratory beta releases to a stable production-ready product.

          Fortunately <code>polyup</code> will parse your HTML and any
          javascript in either inline or external scripts and automatically
          take care of many of the steps involved in upgrading to Polymer 1.0!
        </p>

        <p>Install it with <code>npm install polyup</code></p>
