        <p>
          The change from Polymer 0.5 to 1.0 is a large one, as many things
          changed as we transitioned from an exploratory beta releases to a
          stable production-ready product.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fortunately many of these changes can be done automatically.
          <code>polyup</code> will parse your HTML and any javascript in either
          inline or external scripts and perform a number of automatic
          transformations to your code.
        </p>

        <p>Install it with <code>npm install polyup</code></p>
